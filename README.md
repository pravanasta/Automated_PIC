# 📊 Automated Production Planning System

## 🔥 Overview
This project is an **Excel-based production planning template** designed to assist in calculating and integrating:
- **Master Production Schedule (MPS)**
- **Material Requirements Planning (MRP)**
- **Auto Integration** of MPS, BOM, and MRP

The template provides a structured and automated approach to optimize production scheduling and inventory management.

## ✨ Features
✅ **MPS Generator** – A template for calculating MPS values based on user input.  
✅ **MRP Generator** – A template for calculating material requirements based on user input.  
✅ **Auto Integration** – A template that automatically connects MPS, BOM, and MRP calculations.  
✅ **User-friendly Interface** – Simple and easy to use with Excel.

2. **Unblock the files**: Right-click on the downloaded file, go to **Properties > Security**, and check "Unblock" if applicable.
3. **Open with Microsoft Excel**: Ensure you have Excel installed (preferably 2016 or later).
4. **Input your production data**: Enter all the inputs the system requires.
5. **Review the calculations**: The template will generate MPS & MRP automatically.
6. **Use Auto Integration**: To streamline the planning process.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of MPS, MRP, and BOM

## 📌 Limitations
- The MRP calculation currently supports only **level-1 components**.
- Maximum planning period is **12 periods**.
- Some features may still contain minor bugs and are in development.
